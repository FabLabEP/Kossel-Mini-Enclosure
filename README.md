Kossel-Mini-Enclosure
=====================

Electronics enclosure for Kossel Mini (or other bot).

The joints are sized for 5.2 mm birch.  The mounting holes in the base are for a standard 12V / 8.5A switching power source and a Printrboard.  The little square hole in the side with the fan (80 mm) is placed so that you can access the reset button on the Printrboard.  The hole on the front is placed so you can access the USB port on the Printrboard.  These access holes should be removed and the mounting holes should be adjusted if you plan to use a different board (I'll probably design a RAMPS version w/ panel mount USB port soon).  Good luck, let me know if you need any additional info, and please share any mods/improvements with the rest of the world.
